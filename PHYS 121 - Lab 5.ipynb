The same water vessel will be used to provide an approximately constant pressure difference and you'll use the same Teflon tubes that used in Lab #4 as hydraulic resistors.  The station you're working at should have the same size tubes that you used in the last lab.  Confirm that the diameters of tubes match the diameters that you used in Lab #4.  If they don't match, let your TA know.  For our hydraulic capacitor, we'll use a glass tube.  The inner diameter of the glass tube is much larger than the inner diameters of Teflon tubes, so it doesn't offer much resistance to the flow of water. We'll assume that the resistance of our hydraulic capacitors are negligible.  Figure 5 shows a schematic of a hydraulic capacitor \"charged\" with a volume $v$ of water.\n",
